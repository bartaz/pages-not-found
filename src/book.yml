# CHAPTER IN THE CASTLE

once:
  clip: Once upon a time
  text: |-
    Once upon a time, there was a castle where I served as a nursemaid for the King’s daughter. I’ve been attending to the Princess since the day she was born, especially after the disgraceful curse cast upon her by the uncontent and uninvited witch.
    Even before the curse reached for the Princess, it caused great grief for the queen, leading to her illness and death when the girl was just a couple of years old. On her deathbed, the queen ordered me to raise and protect her daughter, and so I stand by her, assisting the preparations for her fifteenth birthday.

day:

    And on her fifteenth birthday, the curse said, the Princess shall prick her finger and fall down as if dead. But she didn’t know about it. Her father protected her from the truth and gave a command to burn all spinning wheels in the kingdom.
    I was just helping her get dressed for the celebrations when we heard a knock at the door. It was one of the guards to tell me the King wishes to see me. I haven’t finished lacing up the Princess’s dress when another servant announced that the Queen requested my assistance as well.

    The Princess seemed upset. Even not knowing about the curse, she could feel the tension in the castle.
    “I wish I could be as free as these birds,” she said when I finished tying up her dress. “My father keeps me locked in this castle, protecting me from the whole world. And the new queen pretends to be a mother to me, talking of nothing but my destined future.”
    “Everyone cares for you, Princess,” I said to calm her down, “and to-day is a very important day.” Her wonderful dress was ready, so I asked to be excused.

  text: |-
    I walked down to see the King, and his guard stayed with the Princess. Her father would not let her be alone this day.
    “You’ve taken great care of my daughter since she was born,” the King said when I entered, “but today is the most important day of her life, and we cannot be more careful.” He tried to sound calm and sure, but I could see the burden of worry on his shoulders. “I know her mother made sure you are trained well to protect the Princess, even outside the duties of a nursemaid, so you should know how to handle that.” He handed me a beautiful and well-balanced dagger. “Don’t trust anyone and do what it takes to protect my daughter from the curse,” he added before I left.

queen:

  text: |-
    The Queen’s chambers were on the other side of a long corridor. They always smelled of smoke and magic, so I didn’t like to go there. The King married her a few years earlier, in hope of a male descendant, rumours said.
    When I entered, she was standing by a big mirror on the wall. She turned to me and handed me a beautifully engraved small box cut out of emerald. “I want you to take this and put it with the rest of the presents. And keep it a secret, will you? It’s a small surprise for our dear Princess. The gift of destiny.”
  next: [ box ]

    The box was very light and something rattled inside with every step I made down the stairs to the ballroom, where all the birthday presents were gathered.
    I was a bit suspicious why the Queen was so secretive about this. And why she just didn’t give it to the Princess herself?

    That was not my place to intervene, so I walked down to the ballroom. The servants were kept busy decorating the tables, and musicians were already practising for the evening. The preparations were in full swing.
    Discretely I placed the box with the rest of the presents.

  text: |-
    The King needed to be warned about it, so I rushed to his chambers. When I entered, he was talking with his wife. They both looked at me and noticed the spindle in my hand.
    “You foolish girl! How dare you interfere with destiny?” The Queen was very angry, and the King was not less so. “Guards! Take her away!” she cried out before I could explain myself. Her voice echoed through the corridors and I heard the loud steps of the guards behind me.

    The celebrations were about to start, so I returned for the Princess, and we joined her family and other guests in the throne room.
    Everyone praised her beauty and well manners, and she seemed to enjoy all the admiration. They ate and drank and were merry all the evening and if not for the worried eyes of her father, you could almost forget about the curse…
    After the ball has ended we moved all the presents to the Princess’s bedroom where she was joined by her father and the Queen to unveil the wonders of the gifts.

    The small emerald box was the first one that caught her attention. Princess picked up the box, opened it curiously, reached inside and revealed an item she has never seen before in her life.
    The King was terrified when he noticed a sharp point of a spindle in his daughter’s hand. The curse, after all, made it’s way to the Princess.

    I looked at the Queen. She was the only one that seemed calm and content watching as the Princess touched the sharp point of the spindle.
    A small drop of blood showed up on the tip of the Princess’s finger. She looked at it surprised and fell as dead to her bed, fulfilling the evil wish of the witch.
    And it all happened so fast, that before we could move, a deep sleep fell upon not just the Princess, but the King, the Queen and every one in the castle. My eyes closed and I fell to the floor…

    Without hesitation, I jumped forward and snatched the spindle from the Princess’s hand.

    With the dagger in my hand, I dashed at the guards. Surprised to see me with a weapon, they paused, giving me a space to break through between them.
    Away I ran through the corridors and down the stairs as fast as I could go. I reached the bailey panting and looked around for a way out. The gates were open awaiting the guests, but in the shadows of the keep walls, there was a well where I could hide and catch my breath.

    I crossed the drawbridge and was running away as fast as I could until I reached the forest nearby.
    By and by, while I was sneaking deep into the woods, I heard some horses clopping. I hid in the bushes and overheard that the guards were not looking for me, but the Princess! She must have run away as well, poor girl!
    When they were far enough, I moved on. I should find the Princess, but where could she be?

  text: |-
    Tempted by the shade and a cover the well could provide, I sneaked behind it. I was thirsty, but the pail was dry empty.
    I peeked into the well to see if I can reach the water and the spindle that I was still holding in my hand, slipped from my fingers. It fell to the bottom of the spring and was lost to sight. Trying to lower the pail down the well, I leaned too far and in I fell.

    But instead of staying in the water, I fell on through the spring and came out on the other side. I found myself in a beautiful meadow. The sun was shining bright and there were thousands of flowers in blossom.
    There was a little path across the meadow, and this I followed. It led after a while to a small cottage. In the door stood an old, fierce-looking woman.
    “Oh, it’s you, dear child,” she greeted me as if she knew me. “Come here and live with me. Do your duty and you will meet with my kindness.”
  next: [ stream, obey ]

stream:

    “I have no wish to obey you,” I answered, “and no time to lose.”
    I turned around and walked back the path through the meadow. The path ended at the stream that I tried to pass. Jumping from stone to stone I slipped. Alas! I fell under the water.
    “That’s the reward for such unkindness,” the old woman cried after me while I struggled to catch my breath.

    The water was dirty and smelly. It was a hassle to swim, but finally, I crawled out to the bank on the other side.
    I was all wet and covered in mud and dirt. I laid down to have a rest and, to my surprise, I noticed a drawbridge above me! I was lying by the castle moat!
    Two guards up on the bridge noticed me and rushed down towards me.
  next: [ seized ]

  text: |-
    And so I went to live with her. Days were passing by, but it felt like there was no time at all at this place. Every day I shook the beds until the feathers flew like snowflakes, I took the bread out of the over and picked the apples from the trees.
    For a long time I was happy there, but at last, I began to feel homesick and longed to go back to the Princess.
    “You have served me well and truly, and you shall not miss your reward,” the old woman said to me. “And for your honest and faithful work, I will grant you three wishes.”

    “I wish to get back home,” I said. The old woman took me to the well and asked me to look down into it.
    Down on the water surface, I noticed a faint of my reflection. I turned around to ask what I should look for, but the old woman was not there any more. And the cottage, the meadow, the trees were all gone!
    I was again standing by the well in the castle bailey. I thought about rushing back to the Princess when I heard loud steps and voices of the guards and remembered that I was on the run.

    I heard some steps approaching and the cell doors opened. It was the King.
    “We can’t find the Princess,” he said. “She is nowhere in the castle. I’ve sent the guards out, but you know her the best. If you love your life, go and bring her home.”
    All at once I was released and hurried out of the castle. The sun was still high when I passed the drawbridge. The Princess always wanted to be free as a bird in the forest, so I went off the beaten path and deep into the woods.

# CHAPTER WITH DWARFS

  clip: Passing through a dense thicket
  text: |-
    Passing through a dense thicket, I heard a far-off cry. I forgot how tired I was and hurried forward until I came to a fallen tree.
    Here I saw a dwarf with a long snow-white beard bobbing up and down, for the end of his beard was caught in the tree, and he could not get free.
    “Can’t you help me?” He cried when he saw me. “I need to hurry and warn the Princess.”

    “You know where the Princess is?” I asked eagerly. “You need to tell me at once!”
    “We found her sitting under the oak by our hut at noon to-day and…” the dwarf fell silent, eyeing me with suspicion. “You silly girl!” he snarled. “I am not telling you a thing if you don’t help me. You could be with them!”
    I did my best to get his beard free, but all in vain. It was held fast and all tangled. “Tell me please, where I can find the Princess. I’ll get some one to help,” I begged to no avail. The dwarf was just muttering helplessly.
  next: [ search, cut, tree ]

search:

  text: |-
    He was of no use, so I left him alone and went on, trying to find the Princess myself. I searched and searched, but there was no hut, no oak and no Princess in sight. I went on and on, till the sun set and it began to grow dark and all at once, I saw a far-off light twinkling through the trees.
    Glad, I walked toward the light and came to a meadow with a little cottage under a great oak tree. And in front of the hut, the Princess was talking to some old woman who handed her one of the roses from the basket.
  next: [ rose ]

    I pulled my dagger and cut off the end of his beard. Although this set him free the dwarf was very angry.

    We looked at it in awe. The dwarf finally noticed that his beard was untangled and free again.
    “A witch!” he shouted terrified and ran away as fast as he could.

    Without hesitation, I hurried after, fearing that I would lose him from sight and never find the Princess. Off I went following the steps of the surprisingly swift dwarf through the woods, meadows and thickets.
    It felt like I’m chasing him for miles until I finally got to a clearing and saw a cottage standing under a great oak tree.

    And there was the Princess, sitting on a bench in front of the cottage. She looked tired but happy as she spoke with other dwarfs gathering around her. When they heard my steps, they all turned their heads at me. The Princess was overjoyed to see me, and we rushed into each other’s arms.
    She told me how she overheard the commotion when the guards were trying to capture me and took a chance to run away from her father, step-mother and her cursed birthday. We decided to have a rest and move on the next morning.
    Tired and overwhelmed by the events of the day I had a nap in the moss under the oak tree. I slept awhile until some voices woke me up when the sun was about to set.

    The Princess was talking to some old woman at the front of the cottage. The woman was wearing a long dark tunic and a headscarf. In her hand, she was holding a basket full of fresh cut roses.
    Still not fully awake, I started to feel suspicious but didn’t yet know why.

    The Princess took the rose and looked at it curiously. She smelled it with content and smiled at the old woman.
    But her smile faded away, for when she looked surprised at her finger, she noticed a little drop of blood. Alas! The Princess pricked her finger and fell to the ground in faint.
    The old woman straightened up and threw off her disguise. It indeed was the Queen herself. “It’s the gift of destiny, dear Princess,” she said smiling and disappeared into the forest.

    Frightened, I rushed towards them crying out. The Princess dropped the rose and stepped back.
    “Leave her alone!” I said to the woman angrily. She straightened up and threw off her disguise. It indeed was the Queen herself.
    “Stupid thing! You have no clue what you are dealing with! By defying the destiny, you will bring doom on us all!” she said outraged and disappeared in the shadows of the forest.
    We burned the roses and decided to leave at dawn. The dwarfs kept the watch outside the hut while I rested by the sleeping Princess.
    The light of the candle was dying out when my eyes closed.

    The Princess was lying still and lifeless with the rose in her hand. The dwarfs came outside awakened by the commotion and we did our best to bring her around, but it was no use. I wept and wept all night.
    Next day we laid her on a bed of flower petals, with a fatal rose in her hands, and put her in a crystal coffin prepared by hard-working dwarfs. It was my duty to bring her back to the King, so we carried her to the castle.

    By and by we reached the road to the castle and were stopped by a dignified young man. He was a Prince who was travelling back to his kingdom after a failed birthday ball to which he was invited.
    He noticed us carrying the coffin and was admiring the Princess’s lovely face. “She’s so beautiful. I would do everything to bring her back to life and make her my bride,” he said and before I could stop him, he kissed the Princess.

    The Prince stepped back pushed away by the Princess who was sitting there terrified in her crystal coffin. The Prince dropped to his knees, announced his love for the Princess, and asked her to be his wife.
    The Princess was too frail and too scared to answer, so we all headed to the castle. The King was overjoyed to see his daughter, and even the Queen seemed content when we told the story of the Prince and the spell-lifting kiss.
  next: [ proposal ]

frog:

  text: |-
    “I wish you would regret that kiss that you forced on unwilling lips,” I said. The Prince stepped back. I thought his eyes got big of fear, but it was his head that started to grow bigger and wider, and his skin started turning green. “Only when someone falls in love with you, you shall turn back into human form. And if the last petal falls of this rose before you find love, you shall never be human again.”
    The Prince turned into a frog-like beast and ran away with the cursed rose, never to be seen in our kingdom again.
    When I stepped to check on the Princess, I noticed her lying with her eyes open. Was it the power of my wish, or the Prince’s kiss that lifted the spell, we will never know.
    We returned to the castle and lived there happily. But from time to time we would run away and visit the forest in search of the dwarfs and their little hut.

    “You are just like my father and step-mother,” the Princess said bitterly and refused to speak to me again.
    At the day of the wedding, when I finished lacing her dress, she glanced at herself in the mirror, then looked through the window and said: “I just wanted to be free as a bird.” She turned around, looked at me with her tearful eyes and run away.
    The Princess rushed upstairs to the top of the castle tower and jumped down into the river. For once, choosing her own destiny.

    For several days we followed the river by night, hiding in the shadows of the groves we passed by during the daylight.
    One day we’ve met a very old woman who was gathering some grass for her geese and wild fruit for herself. We helped her carry the load, so she invited us to stay with her.
    And for a long time, we lived there with the old woman. Only sometimes at night, the Princess wept to the pillow missing her royal life and instead of tears, little pearls dropped from her crying eyes.

    Near the castle was a large, dark forest, so at the dawn, unrecognized under the hoods, we joined hunting expedition into the nearby forest.
    In the depths of the forest, we left the hunters and rode away on our horses. On and on we went travelling to villages and towns living honest and hard-working life, free as birds.

    I was being accused of stealing the Queen’s roses which led to unfulfilled destiny. I wanted to speak up and defend myself when I felt a very curious sensation: I was beginning to grow larger and larger. When I tried to move I tipped over the jury-box with the edge of my skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below.

The dwarfs haven’t seen her either! I was too late to search in the woods, so I waited till dawn and rushed back to the castle. But was I lost in the woods? The castle was not there as well!
    I searched through the forest for days until I got to a small village. No one in there has ever heard about the castle, our King or the Princess.

    I was so very hungry that I’ve eaten most of the bread myself and only shared the rest of it with the old man. When we finished, I asked where I shall sleep.
    “Upstairs you will find two rooms with a bed in each,” said the old man. “Make both beds before you sleep.”

    I took what I found and served it to the old man and shared some bread and water with the animals.
    How surprised I was to notice that the bread turned into cake and the milk into wine. And so we could all eat and drink as much as we wanted. When we finished, I asked where I shall sleep.

    “Upstairs you will find two rooms with a bed in each,” said the old man. “Make both beds before you sleep.”
    I went upstairs and made the bed in the larger room. I was so sleepy that I could hardly stand.

    Tempted by the size of the bed I dropped down and went fast asleep. At midnight, I was awakened by some strange noises. I felt that the bed was trembling and I started falling through the floor down into the darkness.
    In morning light coming in through a narrow window, I could finally see my surroundings. I found myself trapped in a stone cellar. On a small table, there was a book.
    I opened it and started reading. How surprised I was to find that it was about me! But before I could read any further the letters from the pages started disappearing leaving me with empty pages.

    Then I went into the smaller room, lay down and went to sleep. At midnight, I heard strange noises, but I was too tired to worry.
    In the morning I was wakened by the sun in my face. What a sight met my eyes! I was not in a wooden cottage any more but in my castle bedroom.
    I rushed out looking for the Princess. I found her downstairs together with the King and the Queen.
    “For resisting my daughter’s destiny we’ve all been punished,” the King said when he saw me. “I was turned into an old man, my Queen turned into a cow, my daughter into a duckling, and my castle became a cottage. We have been set free by your kindness and good heart towards both beasts and to men.”
    The happiness was brought back to the kingdom again and the Princess could find her new destiny as the future queen.

    With the book in my hands, I set down and waited thinking. What led me to here, could I do things differently?
    I looked at the empty pages of the book and started writing down my story. Maybe some day some one would find it…

book:

    “I wish I could read this book,” I thought and magically, all the letters appeared back on all the pages.
    Will I be able to find out what I did wrong? Could this all end differently? So I started reading…
