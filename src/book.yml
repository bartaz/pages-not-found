      Once upon a time there was a castle were I served as a nursemaid for the king's daughter. I've been attending to the princess since the day she was born, especially after the disgraceful curse cast upon her by the uncontent and uninvited witch.
      Even before the curse reached for the princess, it caused a great grief for the queen, leading to her illness and death when princess was just couple years old. On her deathbed, the queen ordered me to raise and protect the princess and so I stand by her, assisting the preparations for her fifteenth birthday.

He tried to sound calm and sure, but I could see the burden of worry on his shoulders. "I know her mother made sure you are well trained to protect the princess, even outside the duties of a nursemaid, so you should know how to handle that." He handed me a beautiful and well-ballanced dagger. "Don\'t trust anyone and do what it takes to protect my daughter from the curse." he added before I left.

      At the day of the wedding, when I finished lacing her dress, she glanced at herself in the mirror, then looked through the window and said "I just wanted to be free as a bird." She turned around, looked at me with her tearful eyes and run away.
