once:
  title: "Once upon a time"
  text: |-
      Once upon a time there was a castle were I served as a nursemaid for the king's daughter. I've been attending to the princess since the day she was born, especially after the disgraceful curse cast upon her by the uncontent and uninvited witch.
      Even before the curse reached for the princess, it caused a great grief for the queen, leading to her illness and death when princess was just couple years old. On her deathbed, the queen ordered me to raise and protect the princess and so I stand by her, assisting the preparations for her fifteenth birthday.

birthday:
  title: "And on her fifteenth birthday"
  text: |-
      And on her fifteenth birthday, the curse said, the princess shall prick her finger and fall down as if dead. But she didn't know about it. Her father protected her from the truth and gave command to burn all spinning wheels in the kingdom.
      I was just helping her getting dressed for the celebrations when we heard a knock at the door. It was one of the guards to tell me the king wishes to see me. I haven't finished lacing up princesses dress when another servant announced that the queen requested my assistance as well.

      "Everyone cares for you, Princess," I said to calm her down, "and to-day is very a important day." Her wonderful dress was ready, so I asked to be excused.

      "You\'ve taken great care of my daughter since she was born," the king said when I entered, "but today is the most important day of her life and we cannot be more careful". He tried to sound calm and sure, but I could see the burden of worry on his shoulders. "I know her mother made sure you are well trained to protect the princess, even outside the duties of a nursemaid, so you should know how to handle that." He handed me a beautiful and well-ballanced dagger. "Don\'t trust anyone and do what it takes to protect my daughter from the curse." he added before I left.

      For several days we followed the river by night, hiding in the shadows of the groves we passed by during the daylight.
      One day we've met a very old woman who was gathering some grass for her geese and wild fruit for herself. We helped her carry the load, so she invited us to stay with her.
      And for a long time we lived there there with the old woman. Only sometimes at night the princess wept to the pillow missing her royal life and instead of tears little pearls dropped from her crying eyes.
